Epicurious originally implemented their recipe box functionality storing data in their own database and the pages worked as an old-school webapp with a form post/page refresh needed for every action. Epi then partnered with Ziplist to provide a more robust recipe box functionality. Ziplist provided a REST API to get, save, and edit recipe box data, but I had to build the front-end from scratch. I chose Backbone as the framework and managed another employee during the project. We finished the
project on time.
