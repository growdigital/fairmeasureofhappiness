Worked on a project for a client where I needed to interact with the Instagram API via PHP. Instagram only provides Ruby and Python libraries so I started cobbling togheter a PHP library for use on the project. After the project completed, I went back and tried to fill in the gaps such as OAuth support which was not needed for my original uses. I tried to model the API on similar ones from Twitter and Facebook.
