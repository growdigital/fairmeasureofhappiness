Epicurious is a site with a long history. With a long history sometimes comes a fear of change because you have many systems that people are afraid of touching. The Epi product team came up with great ideas to modernize the recipe page. I worked as part of the tech team to implement the new changes. Some of the highlights were ripping out old DWR based Ajax services and replacing with a Backbone-based approach (no more HTML strings in the Javascript). 

We also added a related recipe riser that pulls in recipes related to the current recipe or the current search terms if the user is coming from a search result. I also built a custom ad product that gives advertisers a premium ad placement.
