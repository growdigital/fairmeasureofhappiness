The pharmaceutical client had a tight deadline and specific requirements for building this tool to query a 3rd party REST service. All coding needed to follow the client's guidelines to avoid collisions with other parts of their site. KnockoutJS was used because that was the framework of choice on the site. I normally use BackboneJS for my Javascript framework, but I had no problem picking up KnockoutJS to wire up the application. All work was completed in time for launch and delivered
following the clients requirements so there was very little back and forth with changes and bug fixes. In addition to doing the coding, I also was dealing with all of the various stakeholders to demo the tool as I progressed in my development.
