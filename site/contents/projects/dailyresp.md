The pharmaceutical client had a tight deadline and specific requirements for building this tool to query a 3rd party REST service. All coding needed to follow the client's guidelines to avoid collisions with other parts of their site. Knockout was used because that was the framework of choice on the site. All work was completed in time for launch and delivered following the clients requirements so there was very little back and forth with changes and bug fixes. I also lead the meetings to
demo the tool as development was progressing.
