A project done with [Gotham Pixel Factory][1].
The pharmaceutical client had a tight deadline and specific requirements for building a tool to query a 3rd party REST service. All coding needed to follow the client's guidelines to avoid collisions with other parts of their site. KnockoutJS was used because that was the existing framework installed on the site. I normally use BackboneJS for my Javascript framework, but I had no problems picking up KnockoutJS to wire up the application (see my [blog post][2] for more thoughts on using
KnockoutJS compared to Backbone). 

All work was completed in time for launch and delivered following the client's requirements. There was very little back and forth with changes and bug fixes. In addition to doing the coding, I also was dealing with all of the various stakeholders to help gather requirements on functionality and also demo the tool as I progressed in my development.
