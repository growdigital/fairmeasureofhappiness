The client had the classic need of little money and a tight deadline. We chose Shopify as a platform due to it's pre-existing UI to enter products and set up a store. Even though Shopify is billed as a plug and play type of interface, there was plenty of development to be done. As developers we know that a client never wants the pre-existing functionality or theme so we had to write a good amount of custom code to bend Shopify to our will. We built out heirarchies not natively supported in
teh Shopify system to allow the client to have breadcrumbs and section pages. We also built a custom nav that pulled in features in addition to the standard list of links.
