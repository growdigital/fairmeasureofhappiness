Howie Morenz is an expansive song written and performed by Jon Gonnelli. The backing track was recorded live by the band all in the room together with no edits. We ran through the song a few times as a rehearsal and then started rolling tape. Herb Wiley then overdubbed his bassline in one take and it's flawless. After the basic tracks we then spent some time building the track up with vocals, harmony vocals, extra guitars and a saxophone arrangement. Stephanie Cupo was instructed to take the
track to "Istanbul" for the outro and she came up with some beautiful, flowing lines that close out the song.
