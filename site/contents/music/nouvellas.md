Chalk and Numbers are a duo that writes and performs 60s-inspired pop. I did most of the engineering and played guitar on their debut album. We wanted to get the sound of Phil Spector and Brian Wilson's mid-60s recordings so we used a good amount of spring reverb, tape echo, and performed a bunch of bouncedowns. Everything was recorded on to tape. Visit Chalk and Numbers' Bandcamp page
