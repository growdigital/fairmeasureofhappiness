Andy had a more moody and dark arrangement of Shut Down compared to the original Beach Boys version. We went with a sparser sound with tons of reverb. To add to the atmosphere we recorded sound effects of us working in the "garage" similar to some effects you'd hear on a Dick Dale song. I always like when I get to play the 6 string bass and I ended up trading parts between the tic tac and the normal guitar. The guitar of course has tons of reverb and tremolo. The solo gets a little crazy with the guitar and sax dueling it out with a steel guitar/race car going on in the background.
