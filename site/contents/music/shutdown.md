The original Shut Down by the Beach Boys is one of their earlier tracks when they were doing straight-ahead surf rock. Andy had an idea to go with a darker and more atmospheric arrangement of the song compared to the bright and happy Beach Boys version. Rather than having the chugging guitars and tight drumming, we went with a sparser arrangement and a bit more reverb.

To add to the atmosphere we recorded sound effects of us working in the garage similar to some effects you'd hear on a Dick Dale song. I always like when I get to play the 6 string bass and I ended up trading parts between the tic tac and the normal guitar. The guitar of course has tons of reverb and tremolo. The solo gets a little crazy with the guitar and sax dueling it out with a steel guitar/race car going on in the background.
