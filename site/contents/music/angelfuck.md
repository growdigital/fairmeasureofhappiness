A more straight-ahead recording, but we still squeezed some Phil Spector-like percussion in there. I normally avoid playing distorted guitars, but I put a little grit on this and tried to approach it as if James Burton/Clarence White played the Misfits what would it sound like. Andy wanted some extra girth to the track so I stretched the wrist tendons and overdubbed a guitar playing all downstrokes.
