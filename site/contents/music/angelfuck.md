A more straight-ahead recording than what we normally do with Chalk and Numbers, but even with the Misfits origin, there's still a tape bounce and were able to squeeze in some Phil Spector-like percussion. I normally avoid playing distorted guitars, but I put a little grit on my tone at Andy's request and tried to approach it as if James Burton/Clarence White played with the Misfits. Andy takes the pianet solo and I think adds some George Martin-like flourishes to the lines (see I Wanna
Be Your Man). After we finished the track, Andy felt it was still missing something so I went back in and overdubbed a guitar playing all downstrokes.
