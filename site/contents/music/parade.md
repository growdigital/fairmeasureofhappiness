Chalk and Numbers' 2nd EP is a more varied and ambitious recording compared to their 1st EP. I think the songs have a little more variety so I think that lends to more varied production. Pretty Colors is the trippy song and we put a lot of work in playing the tape echo and messing around with tape speeds. So Much for the Bay is us revisiting the Pet Sounds vibe with the dark, reverbed sound and the tic-tac bass. In the Dark was the most challenging song to work on with reverse guitars,
reverse reverb, track bouncing, and autoharp.
