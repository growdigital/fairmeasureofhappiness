Chalk and Numbers' 2nd EP is a more varied and ambitious recording compared to their 1st EP. I think the songs have a little more variety so I think that lends to more varied production. Pretty Colors has lots of tape speed and tape echo effects. All of the tape echos were played live in the studio and we kept experimenting till we found sounds that worked. So Much for the Bay is us revisiting the Pet Sounds vibe with the dark, reverbed sound and the tic-tac bass. Things You Do is kind
of a dark Buck Owens song and my solo has a few homages to Don Rich in it. In the Dark was the most challenging song to work on with reverse guitars,
reverse reverb, tape speed manipulation, track bouncing, and autoharp.
