This site is built using [http://wintersmith.io/](WIntersmith). I like the idea of static site generators because it seems like such a waste to set up a database-driven and dynamic site like Wordpress to crank out a few blog posts and some vanity pages. When I was looking for a static site generator, I wanted something built in Node since Javascript is the language I'm most comfortable and I also like the idea of standardizing back-end and front-end code on one language. I also tried to find
something that was receiving a decent amount of updates. I settled on Wintersmith because it looked like it was pretty flexible with support for plugins and different template engines. I immediately ripped out the Jade template engine and went with Handlebars. I'm not a fan of shorthand languages that compile into a real language such as Jade and Coffeescript. I feel that it's better to be comfortable with the language the browsers are actually using rather than learning another
layer removed. Also, HTML and Javascript are standards that aren't going anywhere, but who knows how long Jade will be around since there are so many competing template engines. Also, it's not like HTML is that hard to deal with so I don't need shortcuts. My one breaking of that rule is with SASS which I think is a great enhancement to CSS. My favorite part of SASS is how it is based on CSS syntax so you are starting for the CSS foundation and then adding enhancements rather than learning
a new propertiary syntax like Jade or Coffeescript. Anyway, so far Wintersmith has been a good tool to use, but in the future I'm going to see if I can find a similar tool that doesn't use Coffeescript. 

The front-end is pretty basic with no real Javascript coding except for some WebAudio API use for the notes in the footer. The CSS framework is using Bourbon, Neat, and Bitters. I originally tried Gumby but explain why I switched to Bourbon in another blog post.

The name for my company comes from a scene in the silent movie *Intolerance*.
